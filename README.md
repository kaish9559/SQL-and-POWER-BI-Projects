# SQL-and-POWER-BI-Projects
Pizza sales Report 
We performed some SQL Queries in SQL to find the Key Performance Indicators' values (KPIs).
 In Powerbi, we performed data cleaning by transforming data tools, data preprocessing to create new columns using conditional tools, data visualization using charts, and creating Dynamic Dashboard.
We analyzed critical indicators for our Pizza sales data to gain insight into business performance like Total Revenue Average order Value, Total Pizza sale, Total Oreders and Average Pizza per Orders.
We visualized various aspects of our Pizza sales data to gain insights and understand  key trends like;Daily trends for Total order by bar chart, Monthly trends for total orders by a line chart, percentage of sales by pizza category by a pie chart, percentage of sales by pizza size by a pie chart, total pizza sold by pizza category by funnel chart and finally top 5 & Bottom 5 sellers by revenue, total quantity and total orders.
1.	Utilized SQL queries for data extraction and performed data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) for Pizza sales analysis.
2.	Created dynamic dashboards in Power BI, incorporating data visualization techniques such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and funnel charts to analyze critical business indicators including Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizza Sales, Total Orders, and Average Pizza per Order.
3.	Conducted in-depth trend analysis, visualizing daily and monthly order trends, sales distribution by pizza category and size, as well as identifying top and bottom 5 sellers based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders to provide actionable insights for optimizing business performance.
